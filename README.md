### **About the project**

**Course Registration System** is a program that supports managing students in the university. There are 2 main types of users: academic staff and students. When users log in to the program, the system will detect their role and display a menu of functions suitable for them. There are some functions you can use in our program.

If you are academic staff, you can:

- Create and modify courses, classes, etc.
- Add or remove students
- Create a course registration session

And if you are a student, you can:

- Enroll in course
- View the schedule of your course
- View your scoreboard after a semester

Moreover, there are a lot of features waiting for you to explore!
